{"name":"Pytradelib","tagline":"Python financial trading, research and backtesting library","body":"PyTradeLib\r\n==========\r\n\r\nPyTradeLib is a python library for managing instrument data, screening and\r\nbacktesting.\r\n\r\n### Thanks and Acknowledgements\r\n- Gabriel Martin Becedillas Ruiz, for authoring the original PyAlgoTrade  \r\n- John Benediktsson, for authoring the talib wrapper and helping me extensively  \r\n- The authors of the original TA-Lib, zipline, and the entire SciPy community\r\n  for all of the excellent tools and documentation!  \r\n- And, well, the internet.  \r\n\r\n### So what's different?\r\n- The entire API is a more pythonic lower_cased_api.  \r\n- Everything uses new-style classes now.  \r\n- Newly added files are licensed under the LGPLv3+.  \r\n- Symbol Data Management in general got completely rewritten and expanded:  \r\n  - Downloading of data for more than one symbol at a time sees huge performance\r\n    increases.  \r\n  - Added a stock screener that can filter on fundamentals and/or backtest results.  \r\n  - Data is (optionally) kept automatically updated by a daemon running in the\r\n    background, or manually by a convenience script. [PARTIAL - quote server too?]  \r\n  - Memory usage while backtesting with many symbols is significantly decreased\r\n    due primarily to wider use of generators throughout the library. [PARTIAL]  \r\n\r\n### TODO:  \r\n- Add timezone support across the board.  \r\n- Python properties should be used in preference over getter/setter functions.  \r\n- Lots of work on StrategyAnalyzers left to do. [results in SQL?]  \r\n- Convert storage of non-historical data to SQL. [MOSTLY DONE, needs testing]  \r\n- Convert testing to nosetests.  \r\n- Convert underlying data structures to numpy arrays for better performance,\r\n  memory usage and integration with talib.  \r\n- Work on improving local multiprocessing optimizer.  \r\n- Then work on improving local network/multi-system multiprocessing optimizer.  \r\n\r\n### Regressions:\r\n- The homegrown indicators from PyAlgoTrade have been removed in favor of talib.  \r\n- For the time being, googleappengine support has also been removed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n==========\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n[python](http://www.python.org/) 2.7.x  \r\n[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)  \r\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)  \r\n[gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) [TODO: replace with something that supports Windows?]  \r\n[lz4](https://github.com/steeve/python-lz4) [TODO: make optional]  \r\n[decorator](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator)  \r\n\r\n### Install PyTradeLib:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/briancappello/PyTradeLib.git  \r\n$ cd PyTradeLib  \r\n$ sudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
